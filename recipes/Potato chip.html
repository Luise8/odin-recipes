    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A <strong>potato chip</strong> (often just <em>chip</em>, or <em>crisp</em> in British and Irish English) is a thin slice of potato that has been either deep fried or baked until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.</p>

    <!--List of ingredients-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 potato, sliced paper thin (peel optional)</li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon salt, or to taste </li>

    <!--Steps-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Pour the vegetable oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). Add the potato slices, and shake to coat.</li>
    <li>Coat a large dinner plate lightly with oil or cooking spray. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the dish.</li>
    <li>Cook in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned (if not browned, they will not become crisp). Times will vary depending on the power of your microwave. Remove chips from plate, and toss with salt (or other seasonings). Let cool. Repeat process with the remaining potato slices. You will not need to keep oiling the plate.</li>
